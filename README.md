# Malwords

This repository contains the code for the Malwords experiments.

From the abstract:

> In this work we present a novel approach to malicious software behavioral modeling.
> Employing an emulation-based dynamic analysis platform, we isolate all the textual content which is found in the memory areas accessed by malware samples processes during execution.
> The frequency of these natural language words is counted, thus generating a *bag-of-words* model for each analyzed sample.
> This modeling allows us to adapt techniques derived from the domain of text mining and document classification to the extraction and wighting of relevant features.
> Finally we test our new models on a dataset composed by more than 60.000 samples gathered over a two year period.
> We experiment with several supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms, and show that our textual models can be used to obtain a remarkable fine-grained classification accuracy using a Neural Network based classifier.
