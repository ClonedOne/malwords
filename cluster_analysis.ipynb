    "Since the dataset dimensionality was reduced with PCA before clustering we would need to reverse this step to understand the characteristics of the obtained clusters.\n",
    "To achieve this we will compute the centroids as the average of the data for each cluster and then multiply it by the transposed components matrix.\n",
